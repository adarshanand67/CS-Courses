# This is the client program

# Sequence:
#
# 1. Create a socket
# 2. Connect it to the server process.
#	We need to know the server's hostname and port.
# 3. Send and receive data

import socket

# create a socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# The first argument AF_INET specifies the addressing family (IP addresses)
# The second argument is SOCK_STREAM for TCP service
#    and SOCK_DGRAM for UDP service


# connect to the server
host='localhost'
port=50000  # this is the server's port number, which the client needs to know
s.connect((host,port))

# send some bytes
s.send("Knock knock..".encode('utf-8'))

# read a response
response = s.recv(1024)
print("CLIENT RECEIVED: ", response.decode())

# close the connection
s.close()
