# SimPy Simulation of a food-stall.
#
# Author: Adarsh Anand , CSE IIT Goa , 2003101
#
# System Description:
#
#
# There is a food stall that operates everyday for 6 hours (8am to 2pm).
# Usually there is a rush between 8am-9am and 1pm-2pm.
# During the rush hours, customers arrive with inter-arrival times
# ranging from 1min-2min (uniformly distributed), and in
# non-rush-hours, the inter-arrival times range from 5min-10min.
#
# The stall has seating space for 6 persons. Whenever a customer arrives,
# if all seats are occupied, the customer leaves without making an order.
# If at-least one seat is empty, the customer orders a plate of food,
# occupies a seat, and leaves after finishing, typically taking between
# 15min-30min for eating.

# Assume that each customer served generates a profit of Rs 100 for the stall.

"""
## With increasing patience, the food stall generates more profit per-day using less seats.

## Problems?
- If people always wait for a seat, the restaurant is not efficient.
- People will start looking for other restaurants if they are not satisfied with the current one.
- Only the loyal customers will stay in the restaurant.
- Day by day sales will decline 📉
- Other competitor markets will rise thereby more competition for the stalls.
