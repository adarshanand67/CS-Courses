# SimPy Simulation of a food-stall.
#
# Author: Neha Karanjkar 4 August 2019
#
# System Description:
#
#
# There is a food stall that operates everyday for 6 hours (8am to 2pm).
# Usually there is a rush between 8am-9am and 1pm-2pm.
# During the rush hours, customers arrive with inter-arrival times
# ranging from 1min-2min (uniformly distributed), and in
# non-rush-hours, the inter-arrival times range from 5min-10min.
#
# The stall has seating space for 6 persons. Whenever a customer arrives,
# if all seats are occupied, the customer leaves without making an order.
# If at-least one seat is empty, the customer orders a plate of food,
# occupies a seat, and leaves after finishing, typically taking between
# 15min-30min for eating.

# Assume that each customer served generates a profit of Rs 100 for the stall.
