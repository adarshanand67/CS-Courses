# CS222 - Algorithm Design

<!-- - The weightage for the evaluation components would be as below.

1. Quiz 20% - We will conduct quizes once in a while and the best n-2 quizzes will be taken into consideration assuming n quizes to take place.
2. Mid semester Examination 15%.
3. Lab assignments 40% - your best n-1 scores will be counted
4. End Sem 25%

Quiz + Lab = 60%
Midsem + Endsem = 40% -->
